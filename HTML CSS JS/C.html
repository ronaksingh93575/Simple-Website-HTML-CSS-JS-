                <h2> Dennis Ritchie was an American computer scientist, best known as the creator of the computer
                    programming
                    language ‘C.’ Born in New York, Dennis completed his high-school graduation from the ‘Summit High
                    School’ in New Jersey. He was an academically brilliant student and consistently scored high grades
                    in
                    school. He later attended ‘Harvard University’ and graduated in applied mathematics and physics. In
                    1967, he joined ‘Bell Labs’ and pursued his PhD while working there. However, he did not earn his
                    degree. He befriended Ken Thompson at ‘Bell Labs,’ and both of them began working on the ‘Multics’
                    operating system there. There, Dennis created the programming language known as ‘C’ and the
                    operating
                    system named ‘Unix.’ Over time, ‘Unix’ became a popular operating system, with ‘C’ becoming the
                    language
                    most frequently used for writing computer programs. His works in the field of computer science
                    earned
                    Dennis (and his colleague Ken Thompson) a ‘Turing Award’ in 1983. Dennis and Ken also received the
                    ‘National Medal of Technology’ and the ‘Japan Prize for Information and Communications.’

        <h1><br><br>Difference between Compiler and Interpreter</h1>
        <h1><br>Compiler</h1>
        <h2><br>A compiler is a software program that follows the syntax rule of programming
            language
            to convert a source code tomachine code. It cannot fix any error if present in a
            program;
            it generates an error message, and you have to correct it yourself in the
            program's
            syntax.
            If your written program is correct (contains no error), then the compiler will convert
            your
            entire source code into machine code. A compiler converts complete source code into
            machine code at once. And finally, your program get executes.
            The entire compilation steps of source code are operated into two phases: Analysis
            Phase
            and Synthesis Phase.
            <br><br>• <u>Analysis Phase</u> :This compiler phase is also known as the front-end phase
            in
            which a
            source code is divided into fundamental parts to check grammar, syntax, and
            semantic
            of
            code; after that, the intermediate code is generated. The analysis phase of the
            compilation process includes a lexical analyzer, semantic analyzer, and syntax analyzer.
            <br><br>• <u>Phase</u> : The Synthesis phase is also known as the back-end phase in which
            the
            intermediate code (which Analysis Phase) is optimized and generated
            into target machine code. The synthesis phase of the compilation process
            includes code
            optimizer and code generator tasks.

            machine
            language. However, an interpreter converts high-level programming language into
            machine language line-by-line while interpreting and running the program</h2>
        <h1><br><br>Advantage and disadvantage of compiler</h1>
        <h2><br>While using a compiler to translate a source code into machine code, the program
            codes
            are translated into different object codes. Hence the time of code execution is
            significantly
            less. The drawback of using a compiler is that you can only make changes in the
            program
            by going back to your source code</h2>
        <h1><br><br>Advantage and disadvantage of an interpreter</h1>
        <h2><br>The interpreter makes it easier to work with source code. So, it is highly
            preferred,

            software and different parts of the computer or the computer hardware. The
            operating system is designed in such a way that it can manage the overall resources
            and operations of the computer. It is a fully integrated set of specialized
            programs
            that handle all the operations of the computer. It controls and monitors the
            execution of all other programs that reside in the computer, which also includes
            application programs and other system software of the computer. Examples of the
            operating system are Windows, Linux, Mac OS, etc</h2>

        <h2><br>Let us now see some of the objectives of the operating system, which are:
            <br><br>1. Convenient to use: One of the objectives is to make the computer system
            more convenient to use in an efficient manner.
            <br><br>2. User Friendly: To make the computer system more interactive with a more
            convenient interface for the users.
            <br><br>3. To provide easy access to users for using resources by acting as an
            intermediary between the hardware and its users.
            <br><br>4. For managing the resources of a computer.
            <br><br>5.Controls and Monitoring: By keeping the track of who is using which resource,
            granting resource requests, and mediating conflicting requests from
            different
            programs and users.

        <h1><br><br>Characteristics:</h1>
        <h2><br>Let us now discuss some of the important characteristic features of operating
            systems:
            <br><br><br>• <u>Device Management</u> The operating system keeps track of all the
            devices.
            So,
            it is also called the Input / Output controller that decides which process
            gets
            the device, when, and for how much time.
            <br><br>• <u>Management:</u> It allocates and de-allocates the resources and also
            decides who gets the resource.
            <br><br>• <u>Job Accounting:</u> It keeps the track of time and resources used by various
            jobs
            or users.
            <br><br>• <u>Error-detecting Aids:</u> It contains methods that include the production of
            dumps, traces, error messages, and other debugging and error-detecting
            methods.
            <br><br>• <u>Memory Management:</u> It keeps track of the primary memory, like what part
            of it is in use by whom, or what part is not in use, etc. and it also
            allocates
            the
            memory when a process or program requests it.
            <br><br>• <u>Processor Management:</u> It allocates the processor to a process and then
            deallocates the processor when it is no longer required or the job is done.
            <br><br>• <u>Control on System Performance:</u> It records the delays between the request
            for a service and from the system.
            <br><br>• <u>Security:</u> It prevents unauthorized access to programs and data by means
            of
            passwords or some kind of protection technique.

        <h1><br> Types of the operating system:</h1>
        <h2>
            <br><br>• <u>Batch Operating System:</u> This type of operating system does not interact
            with the computer directly. There is an operator which takes similar jobs
            having the same requirements and groups them into batches.
            <br><br>• <u>Time-sharing operating System:</u> This type of operating system allows many
            users to share computer resources. (Max utilization of the resources).
            <br><br>• <u>Distributed operating System:</u> This type of operating system manages a
            group of different computers and makes appearto be a single computer.
            <br><br>• <u>Network operating system:</u> This type of operating system running on a
            server and provides the capability to manage data, users, groups,
            security,
            applications, and other networking functions.
            <br><br>• <u>Real-time operating system:</u> This type of operating system serves real
            time
            system and the time interval required to process and respond to inputs is
            very small.

        <h1><br><br>Errors in C</h1>
        <h2><br>Error is an illegal operation performed by the user which results in abnormal
            working of the
            program.
            <br><br>Programming errors often remain undetected until the program is compiled or
            executed.
            Some of the errors inhibit the program from getting compiled or executed. Thus,
            errors
            should be removed before compiling and executing.
            The most common errors can be broadly classified as follows.
            <br><br>Type of errors:
            <br><br> 1. <u>Syntax errors</u> : Errors that occur when you violate the rules of writing
            C/C++ syntax
            are known as syntax errors. This compiler error
            indicates something that must be
            fixed before the code can be compiled. All these errors are detected by
            compiler and
            thus are known as compile-time errors.
            <br><u>Most frequent syntax errors are</u>:
            <br>• Missing Parenthesis (})
            <br>• Printing the value of variable without declaring it
            <br>• Missing semicolon
            <br><br>2. <u>Run-time Errors</u> : Errors which occur during program execution(run-time)
            after
            successful compilation are called run-time errors. One of the
            most common run-time
            errors is division by zero also known as Division error. These types of
            error are hard
            to find as the compiler doesn’t point to the line at which the error occurs.

            <br><br>3. <u>Linker Errors</u> : This error occurs when after compilation we link the
            different object
            files with main’s object using Ctrl+F9 key (RUN). These are
            errors generated when
            the executable of the program cannot be generated. This may be
            due to wrong
            function prototyping, incorrect header files. One of the most common linker errors is
            writing Main () instead of main ().

            <br><br>4. <u>Logical Errors</u> : On compilation and execution of a program, desired
            output
            is not
            obtained when certain input values are given. These types of
            errors which provide
            incorrect output but appears to be error free are called logical errors.
            These are one
            of the most common errors done by beginners of programming.
            These errors solely depend on the logical thinking of the
            programmer and are easy
            to detect if we follow the line of execution and determine why the program
            takes
            that path of execution.

            <br><br>5. <u>Semantic errors</u> : This error occurs when the statements written in the
            program are
            not meaningful to the compiler.

            <br>
            Looping Statements in C execute the sequence of statements many times until the
            stated condition becomes false. A loop in C consists of two parts, a
            body of a loop
            and a control statement. The control statement is a combination of
            some conditions
            that direct the body of the loop to execute until the specified condition becomes
            false. The purpose of the C loop is to repeat the same code a number
            of times.

            <br>• Break Statement in C
            <br>• Continue Statement in C

            <br><br><u>Types of Loops in C</u>
            <br><br>Depending upon the position of a control statement in a program,
            looping
            statement in C is classified into two types:
            <br>1. Entry controlled loop
            <br>2. Exit controlled loop
            <br>In an entry control loop in C, a condition is checked before
            executing the body of a
            loop. It is also called as a pre-checking loop.
            In an exit controlled loop, a condition is checked after executing the body of a loop.
            It is also called as a post-checking loop.
            Sample Loop
            The control conditions must be well defined and specified otherwise the loop will
            execute an infinite number of times. The loop that does not stop
            executing and
            processes the statements number of times is called as an infinite loop.
            An infinite
            loop is also called as an “Endless loop.” <br><br><u>Following are some
                characteristics of an
                infinite loop</u>:
            <br>1. No termination condition is specified.
            <br>2. The specified conditions never meet.
            The specified condition determines whether to execute the loop body or not.
            <br><br><u>‘C’ programming language provides us with three types of loop
                constructs:</u>
            <br><br>1. The while loop

        <h1><br><br>While Loop in C</h1>
        <h2><br>A while loop is the most straightforward looping structure. While
            loop syntax in
            C
            programming language is as follows:
        </h2>
        <h1><br><br>Syntax of While Loop in C:</h1>
        <h2><br>
            <br>while (condition)
            <br>{
            <br>statements;
            <br>}
            <br><br>It is an entry-controlled loop. In while loop, a condition is evaluated
            before
            processing a body of the loop. If a condition is true then and only then the
            body of a
            loop is executed. After the body of a loop is executed then control again goes
            back
            at the beginning, and the condition is checked if it is true, the same process is
            executed until the condition becomes false. Once the condition becomes false,
            the
            control goes out of the loop.
            After exiting the loop, the control goes to the statements which are immediately
            after the loop. The body of a loop can contain more than one statement. If it
            contains
            only one statement, then the curly braces are not compulsory. It is a good
            practice
            though to use the curly braces even we have a single statement in the body.
            In while loop, if the condition is not true, then the body of a loop will not be
            executed,
            not even once. It is different in do while loop which we will see shortly.

            is true. In
            some cases, we have to execute a &body of the loop at least once even if the
            condition
            is false. This type of operation can be achieved by using a do-while loop.
            <br>In the do-while loop, the body of a loop is always executed at least once. After
            the
            body is executed, then it checks the &condition. If the condition is true, then
            it will
            again execute the body of a loop otherwise control is transferred out of the
            &loop.
            <br>Similar to the while loop, once the control goes out of the loop the statements
            which
            are immediately after the loop is &executed.
            <br>The critical difference between the while and do-while loop is that in while
            loop the
            while is written at the beginning. &In do-while loop, the while condition is
            written at
